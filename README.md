Lightweight and portable C++ library focused on gpu-accelerated linear algebra. Utilizing the AdaptiveCpp (https://adaptivecpp.github.io/) framework, this library expands on the classic optimized-linear-algebra recipe with the help of GPU-accelerated and parallelization support.

Furthermore, the design and structure of the code is designed in a way for reuseability and adaptability for any particular use case. The algorithms are lightweight, templated, and simple to adapt to any needs!

To use this library, note that all dependencies of AdaptiveCpp must be satisfied. Furthermore, this library has been rigourously tested against many different hardware configurations, however please issue any hardware incompatibilities (with detail). _(CUDA backend issues currently known for first-gen CUDA-equipped cards)_

This code is an evolving project of two mathematics students, and as such, is subject to change and evolve over time. Large segments of future functionality is always in development.
